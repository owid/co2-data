# Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by *Our World in Data*

Our complete CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by [*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions). It is updated regularly and includes data on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics.

## The complete *Our World in Data* CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset

### 🗂️ Download our complete CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset : [CSV](https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv) | [XLSX](https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.xlsx) | [JSON](https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.json)

The CSV and XLSX files follow a format of 1 row per location and year. The JSON version is split by country, with an array of yearly records.

The variables represent all of our main data related to CO2 emissions, other greenhouse gas emissions, energy mix, as well as other variables of potential interest.

We will continue to publish updated data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions as it becomes available. Most metrics are published on an annual basis.

A [full codebook](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-codebook.csv) is made available, with a description and source for each variable in the dataset. This codebook is also included as an additional sheet in the XLSX file.

## Data alterations

- **We standardize names of countries and regions.** Since the names of countries and regions are different in different data sources, we standardize all names in order to minimize data loss during data merges.
- **We recalculate carbon emissions to CO2.** The primary data sources on CO2 emissions—the Global Carbon Project, for example—typically report emissions in tonnes of carbon. We have recalculated these figures as tonnes of CO2 using a conversion factor of 3.664.
- **We calculate per capita figures.** All of our per capita figures are calculated from our metric `Population`, which is included in the complete dataset. These population figures are sourced from [Gapminder](http://gapminder.org) and the [UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP)](https://population.un.org/wpp/).
